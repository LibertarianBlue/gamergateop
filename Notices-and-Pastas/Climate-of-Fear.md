> END THE CLIMATE OF FEAR

This is a reminder that games devs and journalists are living in a climate of fear.

The SJWs are a name-calling mob, bullying both gamers and game developers, and ruining games with their hate, hypocrisy, doxxing and corruption.

- Gamers of all genders, colors, and creeds are being labelled as misogynists; Our hobby is being unjustly tarred.
- Good people in the game industry want to speak up on #Gamergate, but are afraid of risking their jobs, reputations and careers to false accusations of misogyny.
- Real Minority and LGBT gamers on #NotYourShield are being shouted down by SJW extremists. 
- SJWs claim to be tolerant and progressive, but engage in harassment, blacklisting, censorship, shaming, and bigotry. They are bullying gamers for profit.

The Game Devs have the potential to be our greatest allies, and the greatest advocates of our cause. But they are afraid to speak. We need to keep fighting, keep uncovering corruption, keep informing the wider world, so that they can finally feel safe enough to speak up. Only when that happens will the SJWs hold over our hobby be finally broken.

> WE NEED TO MAKE IT SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO STAND UP
> GAMERS ARE PROUD OF OUR CULTURE
> OUR HOBBY IS FOR EVERYONE AND WE'RE GOING TO SAVE IT

- We won't win until the climate of fear is gone.
- We won't win until developers are free to make games again.
- We don't stop until the vidya is free from this evil!
