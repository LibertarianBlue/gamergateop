### Things to note when editing the OP:
#### 8chan:
OP posts have a 5000 character limit. <a href="#text_stat_tool">Please make sure that the OP does not exceed this limit.</a>

OP posts have a 40 link limit [as of 2014-09-30](https://twitter.com/infinitechan/status/516911792103362560) (was 20 before). [Please make sure that the OP does not exceed this limit.](#text-stat-tool)

#### 4chan:
OP posts have a 2000 character limit and no link limit (URL shorteners trigger the spam filter, with the exception of git.io links). [Please make sure that the OP does not exceed this limit.](#text-stat-tool)

However, due to logistical difficulties on 4chan (many included terms causing auto-saging, mods quickly deleting #GamerGate OPs, and the increasing amount of content being impossible to fit within 2000 characters), assume that the OP will no longer be posted on 4chan. Therefore, the 2000 character limit is no longer in effect.

#### <a name="text-stat-tool"></a>Text stat tool:

Use http://textmechanic.com/Count-Text.html to count both characters and links. Paste text with **Instant** checked to get a character count. Then check **Custom count** and type "http" to get a link count.
