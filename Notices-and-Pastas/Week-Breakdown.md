On the matter of focus:
In the week of 9/21-9/27, we have had a list of all the members of the private google group. More individual posts, even a person from the anti-GG side has spoken out in a hilariously warped view that, in his own words, says reality is wrong.
In the week of 9/14-9/20, we did not know of the google group's existence at all and lacked the evidence. 4chan was still fine when it started and the mass exodus came later.
In the week of 9/7-9/13, TFYC had yet to be funded, we did not know that it was possible to unite to donate to $2,000 to a charity in 2 hours.
In the week of 8/31-9/6, a letter was made to attempt to quiet us and failed miserably.
In the week of 8/24-8/30, #GamerGate did not exist yet at the start of the week as discussion was still being censored.
In the week of 8/17-8/23, LW's sex scandal started the week as TFYC came to light, with /v/ donating $13,000 and the indiegogo hack occurring.
In the week of 8/10-16, Depression Quest launched and talk on the Wizards began again as people realized the story, to end the week with the sex scandal beginning.

Every single week there are major shifts and new things that occur. Understandably, we've gradually been losing focus and our step. We need to fix this.
Sites have seen our reaction to The Escapist and have at the least a basic idea of a starting point and they simply don't want to. Between the gradual changes, DDoS, happenings, and scattering we've relied a bit more on personalities to help us through the hard times.
Now that we're getting back on our feet the main thing we haven't done is refocus the efforts to emails and investigation of corruption.
