DO YOUR PART AND MAKE THINGS HAPPEN AS WELL

Angry? Write more emails.

If you're happy and you know it, write more emails.

Sad? Don't cry, write more emails.

Driven out of 4chan? Write more emails.

Ecstatic about Julian Assange leaking Reddit? Write more emails.

Every shill that triggers you, write more emails.

ALTERNATIVE banning you and deleting threads? Write more emails.

m00tykins betrayed you? Write more emails.

GNAA/FYAD trolling you softly? Better get those emails running.

They attack you on Twitter? Record responses, send along with emails.

You have nothing to lose by walking away. You also have everything to gain by continuing.

Write more emails to the advertisers. This is how you win.

You can't lose because if this stops now, absolutely nothing will happen to you.

Not exactly status quo, but you've gained more than you'd ever lose.

That's why I can only laugh whenever they say we lost.

>inb4 shills say it's not working; that's how you know it's working.
