Remember that it's important to point out (where possible) that these sites are insulting you BECAUSE you are a consumer of the sponsor's products.

Identify yourself as a gamer, or gaming enthusiast, or whatever, say that you've been extremely disappointed with how Kotaku/Polygon/Gamasutra/RPS/Whatever has been comporting itself not only by publishing those inflammatory, smearing articles that paint their audience as misogynistic manchildren, but also by their preposterously hostile conduct on Twitter.

Be polite to the advertiser.
