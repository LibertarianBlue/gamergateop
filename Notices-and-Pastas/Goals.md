Having a list of goals is good. It allows us to measure progress. Offering those goals in a list as a point of "negotiation" is a terrible idea.

Make no mistake: you're only hearing squeals about truces from our opposition because they're losing and terrified. This is a PLOY, nothing more. Even if those offering to act as mediators are genuine, our opposition has proven themselves otherwise. If we "negotiate," exactly how do we enforce compliance with any agreement? We're not NATO. We're not even the fumbling UN. We're a consumer revolt and we ONLY get a say so long as we hold our opposition's paychecks in our grubby prole hands. We sign an "agreement" and walk away? They WILL renege on EVERY point. No question. Because what can we do if they decide not to honor their end of the bargain? Re-organize an ad hoc movement AGAIN? It's a damn miracle we managed to get our shit together this time. Add that to the fact that we're not dealing with honorable opposition, but rather a cult of extremists who have terrified and harrassed game devs and anyone else who pissed them off into silence. They don't give a shit about "agreements," because that's just one more list of rules to co-opt, subvert, or ignore as it pleases them, as they have done in academia, other media, and everywhere else. They doxx and bully and send syringes filled with God-only-knows-what to "enemy" reporters (Based Milo) and then laugh about how nasty they are to their friends.

No. No truce. No demands. These people are toxic, and they have a compliant (forced or not) media at their disposal. Have you seen that farce of a GamerGate article on Wikipedia? Just try getting it written more neutrally. I dare you. It won't happen because there's a cadre of like-minded extremists squatting on that article ensuring no dissent is voiced. We sign an "agreement" and walk away, and I guarantee that Wikipedia narrative will be the one told everywhere. They'll make sure of it while we busy ourselves with other things. And if we protest? What? You think they'd be dumb enough to leave us the same methods of opposition again? Yeah, right. They won't make them same mistakes. These people are cancerous. You cannot negotiate with cancer. You cannot leave so much as one cell behind or it can metastasize and the problem will repeat. We won't have another shot at reforming this industry. Game devs are TERRIFIED of making the games they want to make for fear of angering the politically-correct gatekeepers who dare to determine what is and is not "art" for the rest of us and subsequently getting blacklisted. We walk away, and all of that remains the same. Business as usual.

Our goal is simple: game devs should feel free to make what they like, no matter who finds it offensive or what stories they decide to tell, and we should feel free to purchase their work, or NOT purchase their work, based on whether we think it's worthwhile, or according to OUR individual senses of what is or is not offensive or artistic. The gaming media should only serve as a method of helping to inform that decision, NOT shape it according to someone else's politics, or determine what is or is not "acceptable" for release. Until these conditions are realized, and until there is a CLEAR, UNCONDITIONAL, AND IRREVERSIBLE admission of wrongdoing on the part of our opposition, negotiation is pointless. If there's no admission of error, it's exactly like a corporation paying off a litigant without admitting wrongdoing and then continuing their objectionable behaviour: nothing will change. There must be a recognition on the part of our opposition (or at least the community at large) that our opposition is in the wrong. Period.

Everything else is just stall tactics. They know they're losing.
