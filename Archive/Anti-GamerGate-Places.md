Hubs Of Hate
========================================================================

Being informed is the enemy of the ignorant, and they monitor us closely, 
so we need to do the same not to lag behind.

### What qualifies a place to make it on this list?

Places with authoritarian natures, censorship, and heavy negative criticism 
and shaming of gamergate are among the qualities that will land something 
in this list.

**Trigger warning**, many of these places have internalized and 
externalized misogyny and misandry especially against minorities who 
say they are for gamergate. They do this by objectifying them as sockpuppets. 
You may see racism because they do not expect minorities to visit these 
places and these people might even be misanthropic.

## **IMPORTANT**
## Remember not to brigade, _observe_ and _learn_
DO **NOT** RAID THESE BOARDS.
