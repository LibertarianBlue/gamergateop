**[Alexis G. Stodghill]**  
Brianna Wu went into hiding over the weekend. She felt she had to after receiving death threats like these:  
        "You just made a [blank] game nobody liked. That's it. Nobody will care when you die."  
and this one:  
        "I hope you enjoy your last moments alive on this earth. You did nothing worthwhile with your life."  
There were also tweets so graphic that we can't show them to you. It's all part of whats being called #GamerGate. A shocking debate about sexism in the gaming industry that you might not have heard of but that has already spawned more than one million tweets and counting to the #Gamergate hash-tag. Its an online battle of the sexes over how gamers are portrayed and the sometimes violent reaction to women who speak out. Eric Johnson writes about the video game industry from Re/Code and Eric explain how the #GamerGate began
 
**[Eric Johnson]**  
Right, so from the beginning, #GamerGate supports have claimed that this is about journalistic ethics and about supposed corruption in the gaming industry. But, it has originated as and has continued to be about sort of undermining women in the gaming industry. It began as a blog post that was accusing a female game developer of sleeping with a prominent games journalist. Ah, and then that claiming that then that then journalist went on to write a favourable review of her game. Now, the reality is that review doesn't exist. Never written. But, that claim is still being repeated in #GamerGate circles. People are still saying that well this is evidence of corruption, this is you know, a thing that happened. Even though it didn't.
 
**[Alexis G. Stodghill]**  
And the person you are talking about is named Zoe Quinn and she actually also had to go into hiding. She was actually the first person who apparently had to go into hiding after getting all these threats and people claiming that she was, i guess, i don't know, using sexual wiles to get better reviews of her games. But then how did a second woman, Brianna Wu, get drawn into it.
 
**[Eric Johnson]**  
Sure, so its been sort of an on-going thing for coming up on two months now, this sort of online debate, this, this, hash-tag campaign. And, uh, as I understand it, uh, Brianna posted a meme sort of making fun of #GamerGate. Um, she had tweeted some things
sort of, um, exposing some of the, the problems with the internal logic of #GamerGate. And, uh, someone made an online meme out of it, where its a funny picture with text over it sort of like a LOLCat. She posted that and as sort of quote unquote "retaliation" for just sharing a meme, uh, someone made death threats against her.
 
**[Alexis G. Stodghill]**  
And so let's bring in Brianna, Brianna Wu, who is a video game designer and an independent video game designer who said she did receive/get death threats for speaking up for women in gaming. So  Brianna thank you for being here. Um, and we should note that you are not in your home right now, you are somewhere else because you said you've been threatened. Talk a little bit about how these threats began for you.
 
**[Brianna Wu]**  
Well, you know it was like um, it was like um, my friend over at Re/Code was saying, um, i posted this meme, uh, it was just six shots, it was a simple tweet, i didn't think anything about it, and later that evening i tuned uh, turned back on my twitter,  and i saw that uh, 8chan, which is an extremist group of people that were actually banned from 4chan, as controversial as 4chan is, uh, these are the people too controversial for 4chan, uh, its a board completely started for #GamerGate, and these people, um, had flooded this meme with thousands of, um, you know, altered memes, kind of attacking me. Uh, many of them insulted me. Many of them threatened me. Um, some of them were very scary and you know, you and your viewers can go look at those.
 
**[Alexis G. Stodghill]**  
And Brianna can I just ask you is there a general sense of ske-- sexism in the video game designing industry. Do you as a women feel like there is a sort of a constant undercurrent of sexism?
 
**[Brianna Wu]**  
Absolutely, if you look at my career professionally, i speak out on these issues, you know, very regularly. Um, and because of that I'm a target. So, um, I can tell you right now, this is a very powerful message, and i want you and your viewers to hear this. I know almost all the women in the game industry at this point. All of us are terrified about this. We are terrified about our jobs. We are terrified that we are going to be next. And what we feel is that there is a literal war in this industry on women. They've taken out my friend, um, Samantha Allen. They took out my friend Jenn Frank by intimidating her. Uh, they took out my friend Mattie Bryce
 
**[Alexis G. Stodghill]**  
And when you say "take out" what do you mean? Got them to leave the industry?
 
**[Brianna Wu]**  
Absolutely. Bullied to the point you say "hey i have other career opportunities. I'm gonna go work somewhere else" You know, I'm a software engineer. I can work in different industries other than this one. And, you know, I have to tell you, a question I've asked myself a lot lately is, "do I just want to go get a job in an industry that's frankly less sexist"
 
**[Alexis G. Stodghill]**  
And Eric I want to bring Eric back in because this is an industry  that used to be just overwhelmingly male but now it is about 22%, we just put the graphic up, we can put it back up again, but men make about 76% of game designers, women about 22% in the game development industry. Um, a very small number of transgender. It is an industry that is still overwhelmingly male dominated and women are reporting things like inappropriate sexual jokes in the workplace, belittlement of their skills, being invited to quote unquote "meetings" that were actually dates. How long and how extensive is, at least in your reporting of this, is the issue of, not just sexism but really sort of uh, really sort of threatening sexism inside of this industry.
 
**[Eric Johnson]**  
I mean it's been a long bubbling under the surface but this has been happening for a long time. Uh, there's been some really interesting writing online about, um, especially in the consumer culture, the gamer culture, uh, about sort of the roots of why people are lashing out at women at at at at these groups that now are having an increasing voice in the industry. Um, but its not something that really, um, been overt or explicit. Its been a lot of things happening sort of in the office and kind of behind closed doors as i understand it in the past. Its uh, this is really something where its really, uh, coming to the surface, and that the, um, the consumers, that the gamers are really now running with this narrative now. As opposed to the industry doing stuff where its not something that the public is exposed to

**[Alexis G. Stodghill]**  
Right, and Eric, do you get a sense as to why these male gamers are so angry? What is the source of the kind of rage in some of these, uh, attacks?
 
**[Eric Johnson]**  
So, I'm cribbing from some very good writing online that I've been reading about this but there's a really interesting theory that in the past, nerd culture and game culture was marginalized, it was considered this geeky thing, these losers in their basement. And that the culture got stronger because they rejected outsiders, because  they rejected the people who told them they're wrong. And now games are this huge industry and they, uh, huge amount of money represented here. And now it's a much bigger group than it used to be but they're still clinging to this idea that "oh we need to reject people who are criticizing the way do things". So for instance you have academics like Anita Sarkeesian, you have journalists like Leigh Alexander saying hey there's a problem with your culture. And their reaction is an overreaction. Its to lash out and to, uh, violently reject any sort of perceived threat to who they are.
 
**[Alexis G. Stodghill]**  
And Brianna, do you see any way of, i mean you've been tweeting saying you're not going anywhere despite the fact that you are currently in hiding, that you want to change this culture. How do you suppose that that can be done?
 
**[Brianna Wu]**  
I think it needs to happen from uh, from the Top down. You know, to, to tack on to something Eric was saying. This is a problem with the Gamer Culture but its also a problem with the professionals within the Gamer/Gaming industry. If you look at IGN and GiantBomb. These are sites that are predominately run by men and they are choosing to not cover what is happening to women in the industry. If you look at the industries hiring practices as a whole, they are tilting very very severely against women. You just gave the stats that 22% of the people in this industry are women. But I have to tell you, there's a deeper story than that because many of those roles are in marketing. Um, you know and in tech as a whole women make up a little more than 20% of programmers but here in the games industry we're only 3% of programmers. So I think you have to look at the culture from the top down that's sending these messages to women very subtly and unconsciously. "You are not welcome here, this is a boys club, you know, this is our turf" And it's not that the men are conscious that they're doing this. I love and respect the men that work in this industry with me. But they have attitudes frequently that they don't understand are antagonistic and what we need as an industry is a dialogue about this and we need these men to listen  to women when we tell them what our experiences are.
 
**[Alexis G. Stodghill]**  
Right, and you are starting that dialogue right now, thank you very much and stay safe Brianna Wu and as well as Eric Johnson, thank you both for being here.
