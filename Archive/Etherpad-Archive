=============== GENERAL INFO =============== (**GenInfo**)
Indie-fensible! - The Maya "Legobutts" Kramer Story! (v2)
--A  suspicion:  note the documentation trail in lines 393-396.  Jenn Frank receives a lot of Patreon  support from all the major players.  She might be as big as the Kramer  story.  She's already indicated in one scandal (that hasn't received a lot of attention, by-the-by).

=============== LIST OF BASED GAMING SITES =============== (**BasedSites**)
http://www.gamesnosh.com
http://wtbfun.com/
http://nichegamer.net/
http://indiejuice.tv/
http://www.gatheryourparty.com/
http://www.allgamesbeta.com/
http://techraptor.net/

<--- sites to include.
is GYP good? http://www.gatheryourparty.com/
it was suggested, I've been busy collecting small sites, nichegamer at least has covered the controversy in a sensible manner.
GYP  elected to not comment on this matter through an internal vote, wanted  to stay focused on exclusively video games. Actionpts made 2 videos on  it though. -GYPerson
yeah we should really give smaller sites some attention.
http://techraptor.net/
shit i almost forgot about techraptor. they're definitely based too.
oh right those poor fucks, add them to the list.
Gamesnosh?
aren't they already in OP?
Check dat policy: http://nichegamer.net/review-policy/
it was suggested, I've been busy collecting small sites, nichegamer at least has covered
RIP in pieces Joystiq: https://archive.today/V9Oh3
if I'm perfectly honest I was busy twatting so the list of games sites I supplied hasn't been vetted by myself, come to your own conclusions (though nichegamer is based)

Anons looking for a blacklist of things not to visit: http://a.pomf.se/cifkfh.png

Anything. Seriously, just stop going to any Gaming "Journalism" sites and follow companies you want to support on Twitter or other social media.



=============== TO DO LIST =============== (**ToDoList**)
CURRENT GOAL(S): (things have moved up/down, double check these)
--Update list of good gaming journalism sites or blogs
--Further investigation regarding possible (lel) collusion
--WRITING THINGS UP
--LOOK UP CONNECTIONS ON THE PEOPLE ON LINES
--LOOK UP CONNECTIONS ON THE ORGANIZATIONS ON LINES

-General Work: see line 47
-Write up easy to understand summary to win over neutrals (Search for  *Easy Digest Draft* )
-Help  dig into connections, take a person under list 1 starting at line 54,  and list their important twitter/Patreon/Facebook/Linkedin connections  under list 3.
-Take the organizations under list 2 and start listing who works there under list 3.
-Take the people in list 1, and start listing where their work in list 2.
-If  someone starts coming up all over the fucking place in lists 2 and 3,  put them in list 1 with a helpful little comment of all the shit you've  linked together on this.
-ctrl+F  for "doublecheck".  These are people or links that either need to be  reviewed again, or people that others think their connections should be  brought up because they are a possible lead.
-Start writing up what we have as an actual document on line 372
-Help out with updating the recap

=============== ALREADY KNOWN FACTS =============== (**KnownFact**)
How are Silverstring and the IGF connected?
http://www.igf.com/02finalists.html

LIST OF GAMER+ ARTICLES WITH AUTHORS: https://archive.today/0IK44

Not sure where to put this, but Maya Felix Kramer is the one who doxed Matt from TFYC before Quinn retweeted it.
http://i.imgur.com/0YN6DEf.jpg
It sure helped Zoe Quinn screw him over and promote her rebel jam.

Another sketchy train of documents:
-Samantha Kalman is founder of Timbre Interactive ( https://twitter.com/SamanthaZero )
-She also payrolls Kramer ( http://www.patreon.com/legobutts?ty=p )
-Kramer works for Silverstring ( http://silverstringmedia.com/team/%29 )
-Zoe Quinn was a client of Silverstring ( http://pastebin.com/qWX5qTvB )
-Zoe Quinn slept with Nathan Grayson ( Quinnspiracy Theory: The Five Guys Saga )
-Nathan Grayson gave Timbre Interactive positive press ( http://kotaku.com/how-two-great-games-kept-me-from-hating-music-1625773539 )o doxed Matt from TFYC before Quinn retweeted it.

Yet another:
-Mikhail Popov supports Jenn Frank http://www.patreon.com/jennfrank?ty=p
-Alex Wawro supports Jenn Frank http://www.patreon.com/jennfrank?ty=p
-Alex Wawro gave Mikhail Popov press http://gamasutra.com/view/news/212244/Molleindustria_tackles_illegal_language_with_TradeMarkVille.php

-IAC/InterActiveCorp  (IAC is huge, what would be the point of doublechecking them?)  (some  of the advisors of Silverstring had connections with IAC I  believe, I  forget which and it isn't noted in the document though...)
Before you read this, know this: I love each and every one of you faggots. N-no homo.Homo pls.



=============== COLLUSION PROCESSING =============== (**ColluPro**)
1-Raw collection of relevant names in the industry
2-List which agencies employ given name.
3-List subconnections which may or may not be connected from Facebook/Twitter/Linkedin/Patreon/etc.
4-List games of involved game devs.to find press collusion
5-Use 1 through 4 to start to add to the following graph:
***  https://imgur.com/IBgbpFC *** The graph
another graph http://i.imgur.com/G4STs9x.jpg
I found this program which can be used to map relationships

---1:  the people---

Five Guys Burgers and Fries: (yes and no, we should crucify the ones who make it easy)  (Step 1 is just raw data collection,  _all_ the possible names,  hopefully there will be connections or leads to other corruption made in  the graph analysis, but yes, it's gone way past her by now)
-Zoe Quinn
(Zoe was called the night of the Fish hack by someone from the Boston area. http://i.imgur.com/wJDLzsg.jpg Here is the possible follow-up call made to Zoe. You can hear the caller say "Thanks for the shout out on instagram" I think I'm getting better at fielding harassing r )
-Robin Arnott
-Nathan Grayson <---this dumb shit, mother of all manchildren hypocrite of hypocrites having near constant temper tantrums, screencap, spread, and demand he face punishment for his inability to act like an adult.
-Brandon McCartin (Speculation)
-Kyle Pulver (Speculation, where is the proof that it's him?)

corrupt leddit /r/games and /r/gaming mods:(this part is really almost inconsequential as they don't work in the industry, they're just glorified forum mods. except that the ledditors themselves abhor censorship - just remind them of how they banded together to beat SOPA - and can be mobilized as allies to spread awareness of this campaign to the normals.)

IMHO this Twitter stuff is probably meaningless as far as people following each other goes. Everyone follows everyone. Conversations are another thing.

--all  of these silverstring employees are voicing their support for zoe on  their personal twitter accounts. obviously trying to shift focus back on  zoe. barely any mention auf gamer+ articles though, except for a few  retweets.
---Has anyone screencapped all the Silverstring staff voicing their 'support'?

Facebook Contacts:

More Maya Felix Kramer connections:(can we list how they are connected? Patreon? Friends? FB contacts? Twitter followers?)

=============== DOCUMENT WRITEUP ===============  (**DocWriteUp**)
Collate the above into a cohesive document here:

Things to sort as strong/medium/weak below:
-Patreon support graph
^Strong^  Can't dispute Patreon screencaps
-Kramer->Silverstring->Timbre->Grayson connection
^Medium-weak (?)  The document list is strong, but long^
-Silverstring->Zoe Quinn
Depends on how valid http://i.imgur.com/gLmUiW1.png is
-Kramer's Cronyism Network
^Weak, based on the list of "interviews" on her Patreon page.
-Hernandez Connections
^Need to check IA's sources
-Agency for Games <-> Leigh Alexander connections
^Need to doublecheck Leigh's connections
-Leigh's Cronyism Network
^Need to doublecheck Leigh's connections
-Gamerpocalypse Brigade
^Weak, not really "evidence", more just a coincidence of all these stories happening on August 28.
-Original Five Guys Burgers and Lies story
^Need to doublecheck IA's sources

1.List  of strong evidence that may validate a theory of collusion between  various industry insiders (developers, gaming journalists, and PR)

I. Maya Felix Kramer has been confirmed as an employee of Silverstring and also a confirmed friend of Zoe Quinn.

=============== GENERAL DISCUSSION AND CHAT ARCHIVE =============== (**GenDisChat**)
green anon: https://archive.today/lMIB4

Maya links to IGF?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpvCVdFVdE (v1 dead link)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgW5NRUfs44 (v2)
Most  of the connections in that video are highly suspect. Serious fact  checking needs to happen before we can begin to believe all of that. Not  to mention the fact that much of the "confirmed" information comes from  a spurned boyfriend of Zoe.
Transcript + logs scraped from video: http://pastebin.com/4D9xK2aq (this is outdated because it's based on version 1 of the video). [1] is from http://pastebin.com/jrLJyp0W
Differences from v1 and v2:
4:50: Reference to Eron connecting Maya to IGF on Tumblr
6:10: More info on flirting between Maya and IGF
7:00: 'Proof' of IGF winners being connected
7:35: Some info about how winners are selected from IGF.
8:50: Silverstring + Maya linked to winners. Silverstring people: Lucas Johnson (writers, 2 winners - Crypt and Extrasolar) Andrew Grant Wilson helped write Necrodancer.
10:01: cut back to v1
12:25: GDC owns IGF. GDC owns Gamasutra. Gamasutra EOC is Leigh Alexander. Extrasolar is Indiecade finalist. 2 Indiecade chairs are Maya and Robin Arnott
[Greyhound Busses is not included]
https://archive.today/4fH4G Jenn Frank is/was a judge for the IGF, very defensive of their reviewing standards (or lack thereof), and we've already established connections between her and Maya via Patreon


Can  someone please give me the link to that guy who says on his blog  something like "Feminists are tearing the gaming-industry apart"?

What was the trend before gamergate? Were they growing or were they stagnant as well? They were still stagnant. but wait a week or two for better data m8, because it seems like they're still processing august.Ok, the real consequences of gamergate will be the traffic on their sites. If it goes down, we have achieved a good victory.  egh its more gonna be making it harder for them to get sponsors,  honestly. I don't see their traffic going much further down since people  already sort of knew this shit was going on.True, but as you've said, sponsors. If traffic goes down that'll give sponsors even more reasons to fuck off on them.  Yeh but I just dont see traffic going down mate, they'll stay at around  the same levels, they're clickbait so they'll just keep finding more  outlandish titles to get people to click on.True, sad but true.Thanks for the work, m8.found it!

SJW - too vague? too mysterious? we're not fighting a phantom boogeyman here, we should find a better way of describing our detractors, something that will lead to better discourse.
Extremist SJWs? -no, because that is STILL using SJW
We don't even need to "try" to disassociate from weirdos and extremists, just (what is the word...) point out how bad they are, they are part of the problem that is ongoing
Well, the dilemma is that if we don't include the word SJW, its harder to grasp who we are referring to.
Nobody outside of us knows what the fuck SJW is (well us and the SJWs) who are baiting us into looking like paranoid fucks (look at the rest of this document. it looks like "i can read the writing on the wall") especially when people start going "false flag!" "show me the police report obama i mean anita"
Maybe borrow terms from the existing (for the lack of a better word) anti-feminist lexicon? FemiNazi? NOPE, that was invented by Rush Limbaugh. Try again. Why not just describe the people we are dealing with? We don't need a buzzword or brand. These are people we are talking about here. side note: can we stop turning things into an us/them narrative? is that possible

It isn't a bad idea to come up with a label for your subject. I agree that a derogatory name would be wrong, but the reader/viewer must have a box to put all the facts in. We don't describe an "orange" as a fruit with pithy skin, acidic juice and fragrant aroma. We call it an "orange" and give it attributes. This is the way the mind works, it categorizes.


One idea: we need to stop worrying about "convincing the other side" and instead focus on documenting vitriol and unnecessary tangents, and possibly getting a real timeline down if needed for certain articles or posts. It's a waste of time to endlessly fight with individuals over twitter, and we need easy to digest info that is not "tl;dr!" or "misogynist propaganda! go outside". We're all working on this on-and-off in shifts, we can get this done.
The FAQ looks like a good place to start? How about this:

GamerGate: *Easy Digest Draft*
-There has been a systematic breach of journalism ethics at the major gaming websites, including conflicts of interest and misreporting.
-They have also been providing biased coverage, remaining silent over their wrong-doings, and turning a blind eye to the highly abusive actions of extremists who claim to be fighting for "social justice" (misdeeds which make them unworthy of such a label).
-Due to public pressure, they have started to acknowledge their most blatant mistakes (obvious conflicts of interest & misreporting). But more still needs to be done.
-They are trying to focus on misogynist "terrorist gamers" (e.g. harassment claims by Anita/Zoe), as a means of distracting attention from their own failings.
-This also serves to discredit the "gamer" label as a whole (including those pushing for change), to slander many, based on the actions of a few.
-Yes, there is harassment by some of those who call themselves "gamers", and this SHOULD be reported (assuming your website deals with such issues). But why report ONLY that? What about harassment by these other extremists? If such abuse is wrong, it should be wrong no matter who does it.
-We are pushing for more transparency, and for fair and equal coverage, regardless of labels.
-Continued support of these websites lets them continue the current ethically bankrupt and utterly biased status quo. Please do your part to push for change.
-For example, you could visit the major gaming websites without contributing to ad revenue. One way is to use https://archive.today. Paste the link of an article you want to view, and let https://archive.today generate a copy.
It would be much more effective to contact major gaming website's advertisers directly with a consistent message that they should not advertise on those sites for the following reasons x, y, z, and if they continue to do so you will take your business (and your friends' and family's) business elsewhere. [Recent post on contacting advertisers](http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1421478&s=f2f5477b10aad57d099f58e2db257924&p=45847436&viewfull=1#post45847436)

How about "Stereotypical Tumblr user" instead of SJW?
Not everyone uses Tumblr

Social Injustice Warrior?
We shouldn't be doing anything that would be name-calling or other stupid schoolyard junk like that; again no "brand names"
Its a bit hard to describe what they are doing without, you know calling them something that is invariably insulting
Can we vvv
I'd just ignore any tags and refer to them by their name(s). Civilised debate and logic will win this one, not shitposting
We also have to be careful of singling-out anyone, we shouldn't be fighting each other, we're all gamers

Ok I may humor people for a moment, how about addressing them as the "gamers are dead" bandwagon crowd? Or anti-gamer crowd? (maybe this is a little too baited)
If you MUST refer to SJW stuff, point out the extremes on every corner of the spectrum as well, show that a lot of this stuff is nasty all the way across.
Another thing to keep in mind: apparently people think being called an SJW/social justice warrior is an attempt to make fun of them (note: http://i.imgur.com/FyAnMh3.png ), so it might not be wise to be baited into using this term and claimed to be a troll. This also seems to be applied to bringing up cheating/etc. Don't say I didn't warn you.

Also, you want vitriol? Oh, do I have one for you..... https://twitter.com/PennyRed/status/505153095907962880 You're fucking welcome
This is not "die misogynist shithead", I mean stuff like the guy that posted sex toys & insulted gamers as being virgins (he was scolded by his employer soon after that though due to people pointing it out)
Wait for the follow up... https://twitter.com/PennyRed/status/505151296346030080
I see. So they are just saying everyone is crying wolf, pretty much? Also, stereotyping men who have concerns as sensitive/crying (as though being feminine is bad, huhh...) ((we shouldn't be personally baited into bringing this up back against them though, leave that up to other professionals))
We better check our privilege, she is at Harvard mang!
Agreed, the guy/Adam seemed to handle it well though. Seems to me he wasn't expecting that level of craziness thrown at him though
Is there a way/need to spin the Depression Quest shit on her profiting off of Robin William's death? Cause that shit was fucked up though.
Difficult to prove intent. As in "intended to profit" vs "intended to raise awareness", plus its a free game, so hard to accuse of profiteering.
Depression Quest stuff is kind of a non sequitur and not completely relevant to the issue sadly. But yes, I saw the Robin Williams thing. I think the best way to go about addressing it is, it is not exactly pertinent to the context of the journalism bias, as Zoe is a dev, and her game didn't get much other than the award in that one indie thing.
Robin Williams thing?
(correct me if I'm wrong) IIRC, she said she was going to release Depression Quest earlier than intended to raise awareness of depression, for Robin Williams death. Or something. I never got much info and I didn't bookmark the tweets or anything like that, somebody more OCD than me has them somewhere.

Also is there a list of people we should probably try to get this shit noticed? Like other celebs that might back us or at least give it more publicity?
Too pander-ish, though it would not hurt to keep an eye out on twitter for interested parties that are talking or joking about gamergate, don't hop in to "educate" them tho. If it's REALLY important (like a journalist!) then go for it, but make sure to check with people and know what you are actually doing when you talk to them.
A joke suggestion, but who knows(!), maybe Dr. Phil? His wife Robin also is pretty anti-bullying/anti-abuse as well. Yea yea, national television, but if there's no other option, it's something to consider.

Question
The game is free - is this free, or freemium? Are there adverts in the game? Or is Quinn literally profiteering on corruption?
Free, in website form and available through Steam, no ads in it. Please drop this line of reasoning as it is mostly based out of the day zero accusations and scrambling for "why would someone do X to get with people"
Not accusing, just curious.
That's ok, it's just kind of a dead horse that has been beaten to a pulp
How are the Wizards?
Wizardchan? you would have to ask around, I unfortunately don't know much about them other than what happened to them
You can visit their boards and look around
wizardchan.org, right? sounds right.
They seem to be operating normally. No mention of this at all
Most of the stuff that happened to them was a while back from now
Dec 2013 in fact, although they probably got hate speech for a few months after that
Hopefully documented? Only one I know is this: http://imgur.com/a/4VOcx

Other tips:
If you repost pictures of people from twitter or whatever saying really weird stuff, if it's some random person that isn't a journalist or whatnot please blank out their name and whatever. Don't give any excuse for crappy people to go after -them-

Also if I may say so, people need to cut out the stupid psuedoanarchist shit.
I know that one video had bane because bane is a dumb 4chan meme, but goddamn. (Note, The Fire Rises by Box: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDxeFwmGnSs)
People outside the culture will be terrified at the implications. Learn to not be so myopic/near-sighted. This is why people are calling gamers terrorists, because they used a fictional terrorist to communicate their ideas.
Do not do this.

Don't fight tabloid shit with tabloid shit. Don't stoop down to anyone else's level just because you disagree with them.
Zoe using "Quinnspiracy" as a username does not make "lol conspiracy! QUINNspiracy LOL!" funny. Stop. Stop it right now.

We need to just focus on getting everything together, don't make connections where they don't need to be, just get snippits and snapshots of actual shit.
The least conjecture and assumptions the better (relevant article pls read: Occam's razor: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor )

It is probably a waste of time to directly address random "SJW arguments"
We can't solve "the social justice warrior problem"

Also keep this in mind https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True-believer_syndrome

i have an idea: call for the websites that were hacked to publicly speak out against harassment, if they don't, respectfully criticize them for not making a stand. use the SJW logic for good. and it's not that this stuff is so specific or terrible, but it happens pretty much all the goddamn time now.

The list of names that was published: https://archive.today/E4jmQ


does anyone have the specifics on exactly who maya kramer fucked, and the name of the guy in charge of the igf, I'm trying to update my chart. Or if someone has a link to a more recent one.



=============== SHITPOSTING & BROPOSTING =============== (**FunPost**)
whee, so fun :^)

Whats this stuff about greyhound buses?


Is 90 an actual number or is it just a joke?
And really, it doesn't matter how many dudes she slept with, what matters is our plan if any of them would raise corruption/conflict of interest questions.

Yeah, I agree, as soon as there's a conflict of interest even one is too much.


So what now? Do we just wait till the mods stop acting like dicks?
Since when does waiting work?  We need some kind of action.  Maybe get people to come here?
Well I guess I was wrong, Waiting DID work, threads are going to bump limit agian, although #gamergate still causes the thread to autosage.
Patience, grasshopper

We need to define a goal.
Uhhh.... we want total disclosure from our journalists, transparency and those who do not comply to their fucking press ethics to be terminated. The same standard that journalists uphold in any other area

Hey, how much does a copyright cost?

Depends on the country you file it in, I think it's 15-30$ in America.

Put a copyright on Silverstring media. They have apparently neglected to.
They'd probably just start up again in a different name, if that SA link is factual.  Might rustle their jimmies, though.
Rustle the jimmies anon. Rustle them hard

If you'd like to take some direction from modern, professional journalism, I recommend taking a look at the _Frontline Formula_. Frontline is a documentary series on PBS that focuses on difficult, intricate topics and attempts to present a balanced description while still engaging the viewer.

The formula depends on first finding a human story that epitomizes the issue, and follows that person as they are affected by the issue typically involving serious struggles of life/death, losing one's family/career, or the destruction of their way of life. By focusing on the human drama, the viewer identifies with the subject as a human being and cares what is happening to them. The viewer then 1) will pay more attention to *why* this person is suffering, 2) and will sit through more technical information in order to find out *what happened* to them.

In order to explain why the subject is suffering, the documentarian can then introduce all manner of technical information with bite-sized pieces of deep background to give the viewer *understanding*. The viewer doesn't feel they had to slog through a technical manual to understand some esoteric topic. They just watched a human drama unfold and just happened to absorb some technical information along the way.

For a great example, I recommend watching [_The Nightmare Bacteria_ online] ( http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/hunting-the-nightmare-bacteria/ ). Right up front they tell you what technical bits they are going to cover, but just as quickly they turn it into a human drama.

I'm not suggesting you make a Frontline clone on youtube - that would be cheesy. I do suggest finding a human story from which you can hang all this information. With whom do you want your audience to *sympathize*? How have they been affected? What is their struggle?
