Hey everyone,

As Cameron mentioned in the Good Writing about Games thread it's not the proper place for linking your own work, but I do have something I'd like to share so maybe this little thread will serve for that purpose. If this irks you feel free to ignore and/or delete it, but I'm not primarily here because I want to promote something I did but because I'm looking for ways to improve it and, well, here we have a horde of wordsmiths who I hope are just waiting to tear into my subpar efforts.

So I run this thing called Haywire Magazine, just a little pet project built from contributions of other amateur writers. I edit things, a guy from Canada I know designs a neat .pdf, it's an interesting way for me to keep various skills sharp while also helping some good writers who are even more low-profile than myself. The latest issue, Identities, has been especially challenging to edit thanks to the various tasty gender issues we discuss. I'd like to think I did an okay job, but I have no doubt there are plenty of things to improve, so if you could have a look and tell me in what ways it still sucks that'd be appreciated. In great detail, too.

Cheers,

Joe
