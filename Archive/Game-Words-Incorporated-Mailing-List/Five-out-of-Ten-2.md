Shameless self-promotion:

Five out of Ten 2: Players Guide is now on sale. Get it from http://fiveoutoftenmagazine.com/ . There's a free preview available if you want to check out the magazine before you buy it!

I am really proud of this one. Hope you all like it and this post doesn't get deleted for spamming...

Also, if you're unaware of Five out of Ten, our business model etc. there's loads of information on the website. Unfortunately I am not currently accepting pitches because we're filled up! This will change in the autumn.

Nice job! I like your business model, especially your use of price tiers. Personally I think you should have some premium tiers with physical copies, to capture more of the sharp end of the demand curve. Do you think you'll ever release information on how successful your model has been?

We've sold 125 copies of Issue 1 so far, so the model is definitely viable. We're paying better than a lot of games websites and approaching that of big publications.

Physical copies are problematic because they'd have to go through a service like HP Magcloud, but it's definitely something I've thought about!

I'm very much enjoying issue 1 and looking forward to the next.  I think the concept really works -- glad its going well.
