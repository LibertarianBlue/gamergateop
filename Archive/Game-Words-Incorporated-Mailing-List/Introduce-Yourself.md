Hey gang— I'm Tommy Rousse, and I keep a journal at http://www.ludist.com somewhat erratically and generally when I am getting a grade, and try to Tweet via @ludist but mostly I just compulsively favorite everything @ckunzelman tweets.  I'm one thesis away from a Master of Science in Games Analysis from the IT University of Copenhagen, home to scholars like Espen Aarseth and Miguel Sicart, and former home of Doug "J.S. Joust" Wilson and Pippin Barr. Sometimes I write criticism and do reporting about videogames, but lately I've been so busy applying to JD/PhD programs that I haven't done much writing outside of "WHY I WANT TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL" x10 and variations on "No Really, I Am About to Get a Master's Degree in Video Games, Please Take Me Seriously".  I'm also a game designer and producer; my first title is LAZA KNITEZ!! www.lazaknitez.com but I've got some other stuff in the works and we're about to form our own company.  Email or tweet me for a free full copy of LK.

I study games and the law with a smorgasbord of network analysis, sociology, anthropology, critical theory, and Marxism.  As a journalist and critic, I try to make academic work accessible to a wider audience without dumbing it down.  I'm pretty psyched about this group.

Hello everyone! What a fascinating and talented bunch.

I'm Zoya Street or @rupazero. Pronoun "they". I'm a game design historian and journalist, recently moved from the UK to the SF Bay Area. I'm writing a book called Dreamcast Worlds (almost finished!). I work as Deputy Editor at Gamesbrief and also write for The Borderhouse, pocketgamer.biz and whatever doesn't fit there gets dumped on zoyastreet.com. So I sort of do 50% businessy stuff, 50% designerly stuff.
	Dan Cox 	
22/02/13
  
Hi, I'm Dan Cox. I often joke that "I do things" because it's simpler than writing out places where others have been nice enough to feature work I've done. At the moment though, I'm primarily known in association with the Radio division of Indie Game Magazine where I interview independent developers, as the audio editor and producer behind the shows as part of the Video Games and Human Values Initiative, and with my own blog Digital Ephemera. (I also contributed fairly regularly to Nightmare Mode throughout most of 2012.)

While I still pay attention to the community of bloggers and writers, I've been slowly making a transition into being an active developer myself. After making my first dozen Flash games last year, I've been spending a large amount of my free time this year trying to help other make their own games through videos, tutorials, and posting code. I am a strong advocate for the idea that everyone can make a game as part of One Game a Month.

Oh, and I’m Videlais on Twitter, but I mostly use the account to post various things and occasionally complain.

Hi,  I'm writing at www.psepho.me.  Twitter: @psepho

I am a lawyer in the City of London by day and a zookeeper/counsellor for the juveniles of the species by night.  In between the diurnal and nocturnal phases I spend a lot of time on the train (almost an hour each way) which is a nice slice of time for writing some thoughts about games -- so I started about six weeks ago.  

I am also making a couple of games (again on the train) but they are a bit rubbish -- really an excuse to learn about programming (which turns out to be a lot like like law...)

I tweet a lot at @laevantine so do not follow me if your first impulse when you wake up every morning is UGH SO MANY TWEETS TO GET THROUGH
I blog highly infrequently about games (and sometimes non-game media studies) at http://chaoticblue.com/blog

Hello! Thank you for inviting me Maddy. I am Cara, I write for Rock Paper Shotgun fairly regularly now and UK PC Gamer when I can. I started off on Unwinnable, where all of my mad 'experimental' stuff goes and it is dear to my heart.

I sort of fell backwards into writing about games when I got a bit skint (which is weird because most writers are skint because they are writers). I am primarily entirely in love with the writing process, with words and language, and I hope to use them to bring people together, celebrate shared experiences, and talk about communities and community building via games. It is my fondest wish that people regard games as a way to be together and to celebrate our humanity (eeek! cheese) because I think we're all made by what we experience.

I am super happy to be part of this group because I left academia a long time ago, and my critical language isn't what it used to be.

You can find me overtweeting as usual at @carachan1 and a list of my work can be found at hardconsonant.com.

Glad you're here, Cara.

We've sort of gotten off into long tangent threads about doing criticism, but this is still intended (psssht) to be a discussion place for all forms of games writing. I absolutely want to know more about the kind of writing that you do and why you do it that way; I think more than most of us you are really pushing games writing into lots of directions at once. I know that's really vague but I'm trying to communicate a very complex and envious feel here.
	Cara Ellison 	
26/02/13
  
Heh. Thanks, I am very surprised about the positive reactions I get when I just write what I like, so I was even a little shocked when people started analysing my voice: I've always written this way, but only recently has it gained any attention. I guess you just have to keep writing, no matter what.

If it's of any use, the root of my personal education lies in adolescent readings of Charlie Brooker's offhand PC Zone manner that he used in the 90s. I'd urge anyone unfamiliar with his work to seek him out! He's my favourite critic: he never feels like he has to sacrifice a critical attitude to have a sense of humour, and that's why he's so compelling. His humour about things sort of embosses his point on your mind, which makes for an impact that you can't get from anyone else. Also this one time he called our Prime Minister David Cameron a lizard. (He is.)

    Hey everyone.  


    I'm Austin Grossman, I'm mostly a writer and story designer for video games - most recently for Dishonored, but the list stretches back - I started at Looking Glass with Ultima Underworld II and System Shock. 

    I haven't done as much journalism as I'd like but I have a second career as a novelist. I have a novel called YOU about game developers which deals with lot of the same questions that are coming up here - the challenges of close description of the gameplay experience, issues of representation, and so forth.  (It comes out in April - for anyone genuinely curious I can probably snag you an advance copy)

    So far just I'm lurking but really enjoying (and impressed with) the debate.

	Andrew Walt

Hi there! My name is Andrew Walt, and I suspect that I'm by far the least impressive person in the room. I used to be an editor for various campus newspapers at U of T in Canada, but now I'm just finishing up my undergrad in Classics before heading off for my MA in August.

I do design work for Johannes Köller here, I've nervously set up a wordpress for myself here, and I occasionally use Twitter here. And if I'm know for anything, it would probably be for my write-up of Pipe Trouble originally posted here, which Joe informed me had somehow made its way to this group.
