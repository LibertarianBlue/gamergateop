You made it!

On the "home" page you can go up to the top at "Membership Settings" and set how often you want it to email you.

Also, here is the link to the group if you want to go ahead and Tweet it. https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/game-words-incorporated

Okay I made you an "owner" like me so you can do everything that I can--including approving petitions to join.
