So, after noticing the general confusion of people writing in, I finally realized that it might be a good idea to add a page with details for contributing to my pet project. I thought I'd run a version of this by the experts first though. I'd like this to be as inclusive and encouraging as possible, because... well I don't think I have to explain here of all places why I believe in equality, inclusion, diverse and varied games writing, etc.

Basically I'd like to know if any part of this is (accidentally) discouraging to specific groups or if there's anything I should still add to make sure it's absolutely, perfectly, 1000% clear that we don't just welcome voices outside of the white, straight male spectrum, but actively encourage them to get in touch. Or any general perspective for things I should change for whatever reason, really.

Current draft below, thanks for helping me be a better person.

Haywire Magazine is driven entirely by the efforts of passionate amateur writers. It wouldn't exist without our current team of talented contributors, and we're always looking to add more people to that list. Do you have something interesting to say about videogames and the culture surrounding them?

We'd love to have you.

And though it should go without saying, let me stress that we subscribe to ideals of equality and inclusion. We'd love to have you, no matter who you are. This is a place to be judged on the merits of your words, and nothing else.

We consider the many ways in which games writing deliberately or accidentally maintains its boy's club atmosphere to be both harmful and limiting. Our current staff consists primarily of straight, white males. We'd like to change that. Diversity rules.

If you have an idea for a piece, just send a brief pitch to haywiremagazine [at] gmail [dot] com and I'll let you know if it's something we'd like to run. Chances are it is, since we don't have any actual rules as to the topics, format and structure of articles.

Keep in mind that there are downsides to working with a team of amateurs though. We can't pay you, for instance. The only form of compensation we can offer is a very limited amount of exposure, editing and writing advice by myself and a chance to see your work in shiny .pdf format.

If you have any more questions, just let me know. I'd love to hear from you.

Cheers,

Johannes Köller

I think this is good! Are you planning to put it on a sort of public contact us/about page place?

Sidenote: perhaps we should compile a list of all the alternative and self-published magazines and blogs that have been cropping up lately ... there are so many!

That would be extremely helpful.
 
Perhaps a new thread can be a running list? Unless someone has the time to find and list each one with links and general info.

Yeah, it'll be our contact page. Being such a tiny speck in the games writing landscape we're practically starved for content anyway, so it's not ideal that the few people who seem to have noticed the email address in the sidebar generally begin by asking "So, are you looking for writers?". Damn right we are. Figured I'd use to opportunity to say something on the matter of equality too, better than staying silent.

A general list of games writing sites, magazines and blogs would be really neat.

I have a half-finished piece for Split Screen with a run down of loads of magazines, paid and unpaid alike. Just never have time to finish it!

That's because we bastards just keep coming up with new magazines.
