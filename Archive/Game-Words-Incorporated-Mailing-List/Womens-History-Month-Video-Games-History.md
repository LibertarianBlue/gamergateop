This year's Women's History Month theme is "Women inspiring innovation through imagination." It aims to shed light on women's contributions to science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Women have often been shut out of histories of science and technology, and this carries through into the way that histories of video games are told.

Maybe this thread could be a good place to share interesting articles on the subject of the history of women in games?

Additionally, I'm hoping to put together a nice pdf collection of articles at the end of the month that celebrate the history of women as innovators in the video games industry. This can include biographical pieces about the achievements of individual women, memoirs from women looking back over their own personal histories in the industry, social histories of women in games, and many more. If you've got something that you think would fit the bill that you'd like to see published in the collection, do email it to me: rupa...@gmail.com

On a related note, Critical Distance is running a series of themed things for Women's History Month including a special Blogs of the Round Table topic. You should write something for BoRT and then email the link to Zoya!

Agreed, I definitely encourage people to submit to BoRT. Biographical histories would definitely overlap with the BoRT theme of role models.

NPR's set to interview Rihanna Pratchett tomorrow morning about Tomb Raider and her time in the industry---I'll try to link the piece here, so hopefully it'll be a good one. (Also, would NPR count as an article?!)


Also, for anyone with access to American Public Radio, Marketplace/NPR morning news is spending this week interviewing women working in the technology/video game sector---the piece they ran this morning featured people who work at Zynga and other companies, so I'll be interested to see what they're putting out this week.

That sounds really interesting. This Pratchett interview in Metro today is pretty good too: http://metro.co.uk/2013/03/04/rhianna-pratchett-on-reclaiming-lara-croft-and-having-discworld-creator-terry-as-a-dad-3522630/
