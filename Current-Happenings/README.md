* [The Block Bot](http://www.theblockbot.com) is back and "technical ownership" is transferred to [CollectQT](https://twitter.com/CollectQT), a "[queer trans collective](https://archive.today/MCdy2)" founded by [Lynn Cyrin](https://twitter.com/LynnMagic), a provider of "[programming and diversity services](https://archive.today/8DaFZ#selection-167.52-167.150)." In a statement, the CollectQT and Block Bot team members say:

> Currently, The Block Bot only supports one blocking team made of individuals who may disagree and who have a variety of blocking philosophies. The different communities The Block Bot serves also have a diversity of perspectives and expectations that sometimes conflict. **One proposed solution is to create a platform to address these concerns, similar to blocktogether.org. Our platform, however, would go beyond sharing personal blocks by enabling people to work together to build moderated block lists to serve specific community needs.** (*The Block Bot Reborn* [\[AT\]](https://archive.today/8DaFZ) [\[CollectQT's Politics and Definitions\]](https://archive.today/b5iHF))

And we'll see where this leads us. And if the FBI says it's really about resources, then we'll help them make the case to get the resources they need. But right now we just are trying to formally tell the Department of Justice that we think this is critical to women being able to use the Internet professionally and socially in a way that is available to them and should be their right under the First Amendment.

> [...] To be honest, getting so pumped up and so offended by these jokes is a bit petty and weak. And do not be so selective: why so much focus on the #NotYourShield joke (btw calling it racist is a pathetic SJWism) but no talk about the sleeping with the judges joke?  
> **In other words, pull that stick out of your ass, will you? You do not want the rest of the world to see you as the part of the outrage factory you so often criticize yourselves, do you?**  
> [...] the only moment when I was really pissed off myself was the bullshit about "women pushed out of their homes and the industry." I do not remember exactly what was all about as I was considering ragequitting the ceremony at this point. To add insult to injury, this got standing ovation. Not from everybody but still. I found the whole thing pathetic. Obviously not because I do not care about harrassment etc. - as every sane human being, I do. But it was a clearly one-sided nod to the professional victims, a nod from those whose lies contribute to why some women might not want to join this industry. I felt like watching bullies accompanied by the betanodders and the uninformed visiting that nerd in the hospital that "unidentified someone" beat up. Hypocrisy and propaganda going over 9000 so fast it's visibly distorting time and space. [\[TwitLonger\]](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sl2bm9) [\[AT\]](https://archive.today/unm86)

* In an interview with *[Metro](https://twitter.com/MetroUK)*'s [David Jenkins](https://twitter.com/djgamecentral), Jim Ryan, President and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, says "I think the GamerGate thing is absolutely horrible."

However, the full interview gives readers a more nuanced view of his statements:

> GC: [...] it must have greatly damaged the public perception of gamers and gaming in general. All the **mainstream coverage**... apparently there was even **an episode of Law & Order** inspired by it last night.  
> JR: Well, more females are playing games now than ever before. **I think the GamerGate thing is absolutely horrible. I agree, I read what you wrote about it, again your language was intemperate – *as befits your views on an issue*...**  
> GC: Oh c'mon! Never mind games not working, that stuff was beyond the pale.  
> JR: Yeah, and I share your opinion on **much** of it.  
> GC: Did you consider any counter to it, to encourage more female gamers and/or developers? I'm not suggesting it was incumbent for you to do so, but I'm curious if GamerGate led to any positive new initiates?  
> JR: **I don't think you can or should discriminate one way or the other. Quotas in boardrooms, quotas in sporting teams, I personally don't believe that these are the right way to achieve a world where discrimination is not prevalent.** I think if you talk about this organisation, I think all that I should do is to set an example at the top. And indicate that any behaviour that is remotely inappropriate in this area will not be tolerated.

* The [Virtuous Video Game Journalist](https://twitter.com/ethicsingaming) discusses one of the most common insults directed at the gamers involved in #GamerGate:

> It doesn't matter what a person's actual political ideologies are, it won't stop us from using the word to slur people as if they were a neo-Nazi, genocide apologist who kicks puppies in their down time from their job euthanizing kittens. It really is a perfect slur. **You can use it against women, people of colour, gay people. Anyone who disagrees with your ideology you can use it in their face and it automatically makes you correct and them wrong.** They can't even dispute it because the term right wing is so superfluous (especially after we use it) it really doesn't mean anything. How do you argue being called something that has no meaning apart from being a hateful insult? It is a million times harder for someone to disprove they aren't right wing than it is to slur someone with it and have people believe it.

> I wasn't threatening anyone with that sentence, and I wasn't talking about the literal process of signing your petition (although I can see how it seems I was). I used the words "sign" and "ink" as talking about the petition was the core of my article. I meant that the internet is indelible, and that those with open sympathies toward Gamergate (which, **unarguably, does contain bigoted, dangerous, sexist elements**), or any periphery cause, will have them forever. **Of course I didn't mean that developers signing your petition are doing so "on pain of excommunication by the press," because by doing so I'd probably be unhinged.** [...]  
> I've previously said publicly that anyone with genuine concerns about videogames journalism should, in my view, avoid publicly siding with anything related to Gamergate in any way, as **it's sexist and demonstrably repugnant**. That line is simply a reiteration of that sentiment. So, yeah, I apologise if that was misconstrued. **I wasn't threatening anyone with anything.**  [...]
> Gamergate is **full of ill-informed bigots**, and we don't need another Gamergate. **I have no idea if you and Ken Levine are ill-informed bigots, as I don't know either of you.** To be perfectly honest, Mark, **I'd never heard of you before you posted that petition**. I've interviewed Ken once, I think. I do believe your petition is ill-informed, and I hope I explained why in my article, but **as to whether or not you, personally, are a bigot, I have no idea. I sincerely hope you aren't!** ([\[Mark Kern's Change.org Petition\]](https://www.change.org/p/kotaku-lead-the-way-in-healing-the-rift-in-video-games/u/9743796?recruiter=10318792&utm_source=share_update&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=share_twitter_responsive) [\[AT\]](https://archive.today/IeTlM))

> Of course Mr. Schreier would rather focus on swapping 3DS codes rather than [gifting party invites to those press on the list](http://i.imgur.com/BKSDhVz.jpg). **Or that this list decided whether I should be fired based on hearsay.** Also, why have IGF chairman on the list at all? For that matter, why promote this guy's site that was built around hosting exclusives for indie developers who would inevitably apply to award shows he overlooks? **No, it doesn't establish favoritism, but it establishes a broken system that makes favoritism a conflict that could easily occur.** One would expect media to be critical of it, but here Mr. Schreier is singing the praises of swapping 3DS codes while his colleagues get ready for their swanky indie parties.

> *.@totalbiscuit Let other outlets do the same instead of constantly hammering about hidden ethics violations you cannot prove.*

> This is a little rich considering the reason you we are having this conversation is that you accused me of a hidden ethics violation that you can't prove. Regardless that is irrelevant to the point. They are being given plenty of chances. When *PC Gamer* addressed its conflict of interest with Ubisoft, that was the end of the matter. They did the right thing and made improvements. When *Polygon* started disclosing who it donates to on Patreon, that is them being given the chance to "re-earn" the trust of their audience. When *Kotaku* and *Escapist* [*sic*] update their ethics policies, that's them re-earning the trust of their audience. When *Kotaku*, *Polygon*, *Destructoid* and more retroactively add disclosure to previous articles which are suspect, that's an attempt to re-earn the trust of their audience. When they do all of that, it torpedoes your point that they are "hidden ethics violations that I can't prove". They were already proven, admitted by the sites in question and addressed. Those are closed cases.

> [...] **The pursuit of ethics and better games media is a net positive. Equating it with harassment is intellectually dishonest.** Harassment is harassment, I've condemned it on numerous occasions but **I'm not going to back down from my consumer first position because the people I am tasked with helping and protecting are the guys working 60 hours a week, wanting to know whether or not the limited free time and disposable income they have is going to be wasted because they bought a stinker**. Those are the people I care about first and foremost because those guys are my audience and they gave me this life. **I owe them and games media would do very well to remember who their audience is that gave them this privileged position which a small group of bullies have shown a willingness to abuse.**  ([\[TwitLonger\]](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1skbco2) [\[AT\]](https://archive.today/9JDXh))

> At no point have I ever engaged with the hashtag or had conversations within it, not that that's a sin in any way even if I had. Have I declared myself a leader of this, thing.. whatever it might be? Absolutely not, indeed I've stated in several occasions that **it appears leaderless by necessity, due to the very attempts at character assassination that we see levied at any and all with any prominence that would dare speak up for the people** (yes, a reminder that these are people not subhumans you get to bully) involved and suggest that maybe, they actually have a point and you should engage them like adults while freezing out trolls and 3rd party bad actors. So the claim that I am a leader of anything other than my own channel is spurious at best, you can quibble over it but I have never declared it, nor ever attempted to mobilize this hashtag or this movement in any way for any specific goal.

* *[ChristCenteredGamer] (https://twitter.com/divinegames)* [reviews] (http://archive.today/3dymO) *HuniePop* and gives it **a game score of 86% and a morality score of 32%**:

> It should go without saying that this game is geared for a mature audience and I'm honestly surprised that it's available on Steam.  It's not rated by the ESRB and if it were, it would most like get an Adult Only rating.  (Even with the censored version!) Anyone struggling with pornography should avoid this game entirely.  HuniePop pretty much goes against Matthew 5:28 and promotes lusting after (and using) women.   As a Christian, I cannot recommend this game to fellow believers.

Men are not terrible vile creatures who just game and think about rape. I feel like the final piece encouraged people to feel as if women are playing victims, men are completely wrong in all things, and that the gaming industry only spreads male dominance. I think there is a problem with how many video games are centered solely around men when women are often portrayed as whores or damsels in distress.

Then, [completing his research on this issue] (https://archive.today/OYdyb), he writes his final thoughts on #GamerGate:

> Perhaps the part that will never recover is the fault line drawn irreparably across Twitter by the shoddy coding and sloppy thinking of a well-intentioned developer [...] who **wanted to create an anti-harassment tool and instead created a wonderful tool that protects you from fried chicken**. **I don't know how, if ever, the damage she has caused will be repaired.** The other day, I saw an interesting comment about SciPy, and thought of sending a complimentary tweet to the author, only to see that this person I have never interacted with has me blocked. Not, mind you, for any reason other than following more than two persons that someone thinks are 'ringleaders' of #GamerGate. **There are respected people in the scientific community who are now cleaved from some of their colleagues who believed they were signing up to an anti-harassment tool, not a McCarthyesque blacklist.** Needless to say, they are not entirely keen on putting themselves at the mercy of the 'appeals board' run by a small number of self-selected activists. The rift this has caused rippled across Twitter, separating friends (believe it or not, there can be friendship across the battle-lines of #GamerGate!), family and colleagues, even in my own field and, according to friends, other areas of science.
> **The gg autoblocker is up there with Therac-25 and the race condition in the XA/21 energy monitoring software causing the 2003 blackout on the illustrative list of software mishaps that affect real lives. It is the death of the individual and the subsumation of individual actions into a grotesque picture of collective responsibility, all wrapped up in badly written Perl that refers to people as idiots and sheeple. It's not merely bad code, it's code that is contemptuous of the individual and his or her choices. It supplements individual responsibility with collective guilt by association, branding people unsafe to follow for the simple act of daring to be interested in what some people have to say, as if narrow-mindedness were a virtue and interest, a sin.** Ill thought-out, it's been used by thousands of gullible people who believed they were getting a tool to keep them safe of harassment and got a blacklist instead. There are real human effects to code, and code that refers to people as idiots and sheeple inevitably ends up missing the crucial point: that somewhere, at the very end of the call stack, will be people.

* *[PC Gamer] (https://twitter.com/pcgamer)* Executive Editor [Tyler Wilde] (https://twitter.com/tyler_wilde) says gamers should drop the **PC master race** label because "not associating oneself with Nazi pastiches is just good living." Also, he doesn't think "a reference to white supremacy is going to encourage club membership," even though this was **not supposed to be "a plea for political correctness"**:

> We need a new term. I proposed a few last week: **Resolutionaries? Fearsome Keyboard People? PC Thunder Cats? The GPUnion?** They’re not a whole not better than the memes I’m making fun of, I know, but it’s a start. I just hope that next time you leave a comment you’ll consider replacing “PC Master Race” with something more creative, and I'm so sure we can be more creative than to make a Hitler analogy on the internet, a sea of Hitler analogies. When we finally move on, we can still smirk at 790p Xbox One games — we just won’t have to remind everyone of white supremacists when we do.

When people complain about Assassin's Creed or Call of Duty whatever, it's similar to complaints about hip-hop and rap music today saying it's violent… that’s not really what hip hop is about. You can't judge gaming by what's selling. You have to really get into the medium to understand it before you start saying ok – this is what gaming is about.

Based on the dataset he used, the total population of unique users who tweeted out #GamerGate is **154,269** on Twitter alone.

> [...] most of the tweets on the #GamerGate hashtags are retweets - in fact, the ratio of retweets versus organic tweets is approximately 2.9:1. This indicates a characteristic pattern within the #GamerGate discourse network that focuses on **information dissemination, the propagation of ideas and intra-group coordination rather than directed messages to group members or outside**. [...] This finding is **not directly consistent** with the claim that the #GamerGate hashtag is directly used for focused harassment of individuals (although it does not exclude the possibility that this happens, by the same persons, without the use of the hashtag - such interactions are outside the purview of this research). **Based on the retweet:organic tweet ratio, it remains quite evident that the main focus of the #GamerGate hashtag’s usage is information dissemination and, to a lesser extent, commentary.** [\[AT\]] (https://archive.today/zmtQu#selection-1437.24-1449.506)

> The very high proportion (almost 3:1) of retweets and the high average following:follower ratio suggests that **the primary purpose of #GamerGate is the exchange and dissemination of information**. This reinforces the thesis, articulated previously, that **GamerGate is a "trust and curation" network: the primary purpose of the network is to replace established media, which users perceive as corrupt and having lost its credibility, by a network of curated information relying on mutually trusted endorsement**. In this sense, population analysis reinforces that we are witnessing a new reaction to perceived media inadequacy: centralised curation of information (as happens *e.g.* via editorial decisions in journals) is replaced by **decentralised, crowd-sourced curation and assignment of trust** - “if you can’t trust anybody, start trusting everybody”.

> It’s normally not as blatant as “we will give you money if we get an eighty”, it’s a bit more subtle than that. More along the lines of “Hey, before we talk about this exclusive, I got word that X game was trending in the high seventies with your guys. I know there were some issues, but you gave Y game an eighty, and we firmly believe this is an eighty title. We REALLY need this one to be an eighty. OK, let’s talk about exclusive assets now.” And bam, eighty.

> There is also the practice of paying game reviewers for what are called “mock reviews.” A journalist will come in and play the game, and write a review for the publisher, with their projected score. This helps the publisher in focusing on last minute problems, as well as what features stand out for them to focus the press talking points on (as well as marketing spend). Now, from what I know, none of those reviewers ACTUALLY then went and reviewed the specific game they were paid to “mock review”, but someone else from their organization did, and to my knowledge they weren’t banned from reviewing that publisher’s future titles (although I could be wrong on that one).

* 8chan was down for more than 24 hours. In a [Downtime FAQ] (http://pastie.org/pastes/9819589/text), [8chan Administrator Hotwheels] (https://twitter.com/infinitechan) said that they were "aiming to bring 8chan.co back in the next 12 hours, but that could very easily become 24 or 48";

* The [Electronic Frontier Foundation] (https://www.eff.org/) published an article about [online harassment] (https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/facing-challenge-online-harassment) where they claimed "the best solutions to harassment do not lie with creating new laws, or expecting corporations to police in the best interests of the harassed. Instead, we think the best course of action will be rooted in the core ideals underpinning the Internet: decentralization, creativity, community, and user empowerment." Chris Kluwe used the opportunity to [misrepresent the EFF's opinion] (http://archive.today/d6pH7):

> Some have suggested revising Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA 230) to get companies more interested in protecting the targets of harassment. CDA 230 establishes that intermediaries like ISPs, Web forums, and social media sites are protected against a range of laws that might otherwise be used to hold them legally responsible for what others say and do. These proposals would make intermediaries at least partially liable for the actions of their users. Such a change would be a serious threat to companies’ financial bottom line.
> Unfortunately, instead of strengthening commitment to combating harassment, that financial risk would likely instead devastate online communities. **Faced with a risk of such liability, many companies will choose to expel all forms of controversial speech from their platforms, including legitimate anger and political organizing.** If, for example, any mention of Israel and Palestine sparked a barrage of harassment and then legal claims, how long would it be before service providers would ban mention of that political situation? **When a magnet for harassment like Gamergate takes place on a social platform, will that platform's operators seek to uncover who the wrongdoers are—or will they simply prohibit all from speaking out and documenting their experience?** (*Facing the Challenge of Online Harassment* [\[AT\]] (https://archive.today/4LgIx#selection-555.0-563.762))

> Who'd have thought that videogamers, snootily and wrongly written off by modern culture as bedroom-bound blokes with hygiene problems, would be **manning the barricades in the fight for freedom of thought**? That's what happened this year. In the #GamerGate controversy, which started life as a silly spat over videogame journalism but speedily morphed into a Culture War by media feminists against allegedly sexist videogames, gamers everywhere stopped taking part in pretend wars on their TV screens and instead engaged in a real, moral war for their right to play what they want. In a year in which all sorts, from Sony to Oxford University, caved in to demands to STFU and stop saying or showing offensive stuff, gamers said: "No." **They put down a flag, and anyone who believes in the freedom to think, to imagine, to pretend, should rally behind it** — even if you've never heard of, far less played, *GTA* or *World of Warcraft*.

![GameJournoPros](http://a.pomf.se/vivngp.png) The articles consitute a massive smear campaign by the online games media on the worldwide gaming community.
Many of the articles explicitly tie the previous scandal stemming from Eron Gjoni's revelations to the recent threats faced by Anita Sarkeesian.
Editorial collusion between games websites in the creation of this narrative is heavily suspected. These suspicions are later validated by the UK journalist Milo Yiannopoulos'  [exposure of the secretive GameJournoPros mailing list.](http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-London/2014/09/17/Exposed-the-secret-mailing-list-of-the-gaming-journalism-elite).

* Hollywood actor Adam Baldwin [coins the hashtag "#Gamergate" in a tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamBaldwin/status/504801169638567936). The Scandal now has a name.

She also discusses how a lot of harrassment around the issue is coming from the social justice side. [\[TW\]](https://twitter.com/MissAngerist/status/504234850560536576)

* The first [4chan post is made proposing](http://archive.moe/v/thread/260138054/#260147078) the idea that will eventually become "Operation Disrespectful Nod", gamers email campaign to sponsors of corrupt websites.

* Anita Sarkeesian recieves death threats from an "@kdobbsz" twitter account, and tweets that she has recieved them on [the Feminist Frequency twitter account](http://archive.today/KszKR).

Polygon's sister site [Verge is quick to tie the threats](https://archive.today/HF9DC) into the ongoing scandal between gamers and games journalists resulting from Eron Gjoni's post. Sarkeesian will later be conflated with the ongoing scandal in the "Gamers are Dead" article barrage.

### [⇧] Aug 26th (Tuesday)

* In response to [earlier revelations](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2ejs7v/gaming_journalists_patricia_hernandez_of_kotaku/) Kotaku editor Stephen Totilo [releases a statement](https://archive.today/PQ9EM) on their stance towards Patreon donations from writers to Developers, which Kotaku now regards as a conflict of interest which it is now "nixing".

* After some pressure, Polygon also [releases a statment](https://archive.today/vDVlT), saying they have asked all staff to disclose any Patreon contribution they have made to developers. Polgon did not state that it found such donations constitutied a conflict of interest. Polgon also stated that articles would be retroactively updated to note such contributions, and that notices of such updates would be given. As of, 27 Oct 2014, [no notices of any such updates have been made](https://archive.today/q4Afh).

* Joss Whedon [tweets in praise of Anita Sarkessian's videos](https://twitter.com/josswhedon/status/504508687722250240)[(TS)](http://tweetsave.com/josswhedon/status/504508687722250240)[(AT)](https://archive.today/ewiY1), saying that he has just seen "bunch of women get sliced up in video games".

* A blogger publishes an article [contrasting Anita Sarkeesian's claims with those of Jack Thompson](https://archive.today/LHAnf). The demonization of gamers as misogyist is decried, and the use of "culture of intimidation" being used to silence critics of such demonization is discussed. 

### [⇧] Aug 25th (Monday)

* A short video covering the harrassment and DDoSing of TFYC after their encounter with Zoe Quinn - http://youtu.be/xiWADnV8pmw

* The first instance of gamers being compared to the terrorist group ISIS. Journalist [Devin Faraci has more respect for ISIS](http://i.imgur.com/sNCIuBR.png) than for gamers investigating Quinn.

* A thread is started in the /r/KotakuInAction subreddit, of [conflicts of interest in published articles at Kotaku and Polygon](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2ejs7v/gaming_journalists_patricia_hernandez_of_kotaku/). A games reviewer at Kotaku

* In the middle of the ongoing furore, Feminist Frequency release their latest [Tropes vs Women video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i_RPr9DwMA). The video makes claims that several popular video game titles sexually objectify women, and even promote necrophilia. Over selected clips, the video claims that the games use exotic dancer, prostitutes, and even "mutilated eroticized female bodies", to "sexually arouse straight male viewers". The video claims that several AAA games "capitalize on scenes of sexual violence [..] gleefully" and "frame misogyny and sexual exploitation as an everlasting fact of life". Despite gamers noting that [almost all the videos clips were taken out of context](http://archive.moe/v/thread/259801697/#259809487) and [have completely misrepresented the images shown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRSaLZidWI&t=1m34s), again almost all major game news sites [heap](http://kotaku.com/the-problem-with-the-casual-cruelty-against-women-in-vi-1626659439) [praise](http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/25/6066825/tropes-vs-women-in-video-games-women-as-background-decoration-2) on the new video. Since comments have been disabled on the video, and with games sites now censoring most discuss, most gamers are left with no direct right of reply to Feminist Frequency's claims.

* TotalBiscuit's post is reposted in the Reddit [/r/gaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming) subreddit. Reddit moderators delete 25,000 comments [in the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/2dz0gs/totalbiscuit_discusses_the_state_of_games/). [\[AT\]](https://archive.today/ENcGC).
* One of the /r/Gaming moderators was in [contact with Quinn](http://i.imgur.com/0ZAaahT.png). The same moderator [stated](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/2dzrlv/on_zoe_quinn_censorship_doxxing_and_general/) that the mass deletions were to prevent doxxing.
* Gamers unable to speak in /r/gaming flood into related subreddits such as [/r/games, which are also been deleting comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2dzpmx/rgames_meta_discussion_500000_readers_zoe_quinn/). /r/Games has a readership of 500,000 at this point. [\[AT\]](https://archive.today/Ru0PK).
* The moderator XavierMendel of /r/Games was later removed from their position for resisting the extensive censorship on reddit, and gave an audio interview [audio interview](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/18.860015-Reddit-Moderators-accused-of-Corruption-Allegedly-threatened-former-mod-speaks-out), and made two written accounts detailing the heavy censorship of the scandal which took place in the /r/Games subreddit alone between Aug 18th to the 22nd, including manual and automatic deletions, and shadowbanning of users. [1](http://xaviermendel.com/gamergate/), [2](http://xaviermendel.com/gamergate2/).

* Most major gaming websites such as NeoGAF, and the [Gamespot forums](http://www.gamespot.com/forums/system-wars-314159282/zoe-quinn-saga-reddit-4chan-ect-being-censored-by--31506935/) heavily moderate, edit, delete, and censor discussion of the controversy. 4chan /v/ mods are allegedly [also deleting some threads](http://archive.moe/v/thread/258585323/#258587729). [The Escapist Forums](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/18.858347-Zoe-Quinn-and-the-surrounding-controversy) remains one of the few major websites still permitting open discussion of the controversy.

* ![GameJournoPros](http://a.pomf.se/vivngp.png) It is later revealed in one of the [GameJournoPro Email List Leaks](http://yiannopoulos.net/2014/09/19/gamejournopros-zoe-quinn-email-dump/) that the Escapist's Editor Greg Tito was put under considerable pressure to shut down the Escapist forum discussion by other members of the secret mailing list, including Ben Kuchera of Polygon, and Kyle Orland of Ars Technica.

* The other major gaming website where discussion of the topic is still quasi-permitted is the video games, or "/v/" board on the anonymous imageboard site 4chan. Despite [thread deletions](http://archive.moe/v/thread/258661684/#258661943), discussion takes places owing to the sheer volume of users making new threads.

* Zoe Quinn's tumblr and twiiter accounts are allegedly hacked and her information doxxed by "4CHAN.ORG/V/".

### [⇧] Aug 16th (Saturday)

* Eron Gjoni publishes the Zoe Post: http://thezoepost.wordpress.com/ ; https://archive.today/YWrmI. 

 The long post outlines Eron's breakup with a game developer called Zoe Quinn, alleging several private actions which are in contrast with her public persona as a developer.
 The post reveals that Quinn had had affairs with several prominent individuals in the games industry. In particular, it is revealed that Quinn had an affair with games journalist Nathan Grayson, who is noted to write for Kotaku, one of the largest game news websites in the world. Grayson had previously [given prominent coverage to Quinn's game Depression Quest](https://archive.today/38dwH) when writing for Rock Paper Shotgun, and had also given the game and [Quinn's intention to run her own Game Jam coverage in a Kotaku story](https://archive.today/0KhZv).
For several years, Kotaku and other major gaming news sites, had adopted editorial stances highly critical of gaming and gamers' "sexist" attitudes towards women.

UPDATE: This description previously stated that Grayson had reviewed Depression Quest. This has been corrected to note that Grayson gave coverage to the game, and to the game jam.

* Eron first posts his revelations about Zoe Quinn in the somethingawful.com and Penny Arcade forums. The threads are swiftly deleted.

* Eron subsequently begins publishing his revelations on a wordpress blog. [(1)](https://medium.com/@srachel_m/gamergate-launched-in-my-apartment-and-internet-im-sorry-not-that-sorry-13e5650fd172)

[Within a short time](http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2gtqoq/the_story_of_the_fine_young_capitalists_and_the/), they and [several followers](http://a.pomf.se/ooylib.jpg) take issue with the project, calling its transgender policy ["exploitative"](https://twitter.com/TheQuinnspiracy/status/439565723996655616). TFYC site is [DDoSed](https://archive.today/zWMxS), and their twitter account is temporarily suspended as followers have flagged their [feminist video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eN-Gmmfd0E&list=UUhwoDCOjliin3x0Y_ShiGGw) as offensive.

### [⇧] Jun 2013

* A Larian studios artist who worked on the Kickstarter funded video game "Divinity: Original Sin", reveals that the company was [pressured to self-censor the game's cover artwork](http://orogion.deviantart.com/journal/Save-the-Boob-plate-380891149). Depiction's of a woman's bare midriff were declared sexist and Larian studios recieved hate threatening emails [until the cover art was altered](http://i.imgur.com/Ltt3uxA.jpg). The harrassment and forced self-censorship is alleged to be due to a "strong lobby" which has operated in a similar way towards artists in the comic book industry. 

### [⇧] May 2013

* ![GameJournoPros](http://a.pomf.se/vivngp.png) Following the [attempted suicide](https://archive.today/5EMOY) of a games developer in a live Twitch stream after the cancellation of their IndieGoGo campaign fund, both Twitch and IndieGoGo come under fire, with death threats and protests against the latter. To calm the situation, Destructoid game journalist Allisatir Pinsof reveals  on twitter [that Destructoid had uncovered that the campaign was being fraudlently used](http://pastebin.com/nnR5gqdX) to fund the the developers SRS surgery. He necessarily reveals the developer as a transperson in the process("outing"). Pinsof and Destrutoid subsequently come [under fire for this outing](https://archive.today/g4Syg), and are faced and with [calls](https://archive.today/5C1lS) to remove Pinsof.

    Destructoid owner Yanier "Niero" Gonzalez consults with several others on the [GameJournoPros](http://cdn.breitbart.com/Breitbart-London/2014/09/21/GameJournoPros-we-reveal-every-journalist-on-the-list) mailing list, who advise Gonzalez to "fire" Pinsof. On their advice, Gonzalez terminates Pinsof's employment on May 17th. Following this Pinsof [reconciles with the developer](http://gamersagainstbigotry.org/2013/05/chloe-allistair-roundtable/). After further consultation with GameJournoPro members and editors, Ben Kurchera and Kyle Orland, Gonzalez annouces the firing and publically accuses Pinsof of insubordination, despite Pinsof's protest that he was never ordered to withhold the story. The public condemnation of Destructoid subsides.

    Afterwards, Destructoid Editor Dale North takes to the GameJournoPros mailing list to advices members to ignore any attempt from Pinsof to "reach out" to them. Senior members of the list agree to blacklist Pinsof, who is subsequently unable to have his side of the story heard at any game news outlet or find employment in games journalism.

* After long production delays, Feminist Frequency release their first Kickstarter funded video [Tropes Vs Women Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6p5AZp7r_Q), which claims that several iconic video game series "help to normalize extremely toxic, patronizing and paternalistic attitudes about women".

* ![GameJournoPros](http://a.pomf.se/vivngp.png) At some point in 2010, using JournoList as ["inspiration"](http://a.pomf.se/ryxrtd.jpeg), Kyle Orland, then Gamasutra Editor, founds another private Google Groups email list "Game Journalism Professionals", or "GameJouroPros". When the existence of the list [was later revealed in 2014]((https://archive.today/LhhIT)) by Milo Yiannopoulos, Orland's intial response was ["I regret nothing"](https://archive.today/73GMk), later claiming that the list was ["A place to chat"](https://archive.today/LhhIT).

Initially founded in 2007 by then blogger Ezra Klein, its existence [was initially revealed](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/20086.html) in 2009. However, after compromising comments of list members were [published in 2010], leading to the resignation of [David Weigel](http://www.politico.com/blogs/onmedia/0610/Dave_Weigel_resigns.html), the founder Ezra Klein [closed the list](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0610/39025.html).
