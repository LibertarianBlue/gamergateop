### Need to update or make changes to the OP (or anything)?

* Make an account on [GitGud](https://gitgud.net/) ([click here to sign up](https://gitgud.net/users/sign_up), make a [cock.li email](https://cock.li/) if you want to keep your normal email safe from doxing).
* Submit an [issue](https://gitgud.net/gamergate/gamergateop/issues/new?issue%5Bassignee_id%5D=&issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=) OR [fork the repository](https://gitgud.net/gamergate/gamergateop/clone), make your changes, then submit a Merge Request
  OR post your changes/updates/issues to the IRC #4free @ rizon.

### Things to note when editing the OP:

**8chan:**

OP posts have a 5000 character limit. Please make sure that the OP does not exceed this limit.

OP posts have a 40 link limit [as of September 30, 2014](http://archive.today/gpbrs) (was 20 before). [Please make sure that the OP does not exceed this limit](https://gitgud.net/gamergate/gamergateop/tree/master#text-stat-tool).

**4chan:**

OP posts have a 2000 character limit and no link limit (URL shorteners trigger the spam filter, with the exception of git.io links). [Please make sure that the OP does not exceed this limit](https://gitgud.net/gamergate/gamergateop/tree/master#text-stat-tool).

However, due to logistical difficulties on 4chan (many included terms causing auto-saging, mods quickly deleting #GamerGate OPs, and the increasing amount of content being impossible to fit within 2000 characters), assume that the OP will no longer be posted on 4chan. Therefore, the 2000 character limit is no longer in effect.

**Text stat tool:**

Use [http://textmechanic.com/Count-Text.html](http://textmechanic.com/Count-Text.html) to count both characters and links. Paste text with **Instant** checked to get a character count. Then check **Custom Count** and type "http" to get a link count.
