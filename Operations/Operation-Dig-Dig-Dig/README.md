Hi gamers from the Cathedral of Misogyny, welcome to the series called, "the rabbit hole goes deeper!"
Gamers AKA pedophiles, MRA, terrorists, Muslims, ISIS, zombies, female sockpuppets, manchildren, Nazis etc...
 
Things have been going out of hand, so it would be best to refocus ourselves to more digging you miners.

We need more research done on the following companies, look at connections, follow
ideas and hunches. Remain objective. An example of good research is [here]

4. The Indie Devs Clique:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

There isn't much info because we don't know how many cliques are there and how many people are in it.
 
5. Patreon Circles:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I brought this up on the etherpad.  Since that's gone now, it should probably be brought up here.  Silverstring kind of covered it up.

The claim is Mikhail Popov paid off Alex Wawro to give Mollieindustria press.

Here are the Patreon page images:

- Mikhail Popov http://mediacrush.net/24o69UndxjxW

If anyone can make this clearer by Twitter logs or whatnot, it would be appreciated.
 
6. The Censorship on Reddit
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The masterminds behind the admins needs to be discovered, maybe the ones who own reddit.

7. The Steam Consensus
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please see http://redd.it/2h6ixy .  There is some funny business regarding Kotaku's numbers...
 
8. The group who sent the message "Gamers are dead" to all the sites.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

It would be low priority but it would be nice to know who was the messenger that sent to all the sites this message gamers are dead.
