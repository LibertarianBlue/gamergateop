## Information is a key ally, harness it 

So, it seems that many people are being baited and losing arguments. Within past debates you have seen our own members being trapped by well known SJW individuals and are helpless to watch their fate fall down to spaghetti. Not going to mentions names but they were mostly in livestream. Oh the debacle!
 
Well, before you even initiate debate, unless you know how to, here are some sites that can help you read the enemy's baits and counter it.
