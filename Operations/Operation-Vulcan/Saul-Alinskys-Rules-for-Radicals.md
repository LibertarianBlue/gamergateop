# Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals

Tactics used by SJWs parallel Saul Alinsky’s *Rules for Radicals*.

Saul Alinsky (1909-1972) is generally considered to be the founder of modern community organizing. Based on his work with Chicago’s slum community, Alinsky went on to repeat those efforts in other slum communities across the nation. He is best known for his book *Rules for Radicals*, in which he listed 13 rules on how the have-nots can take power away from the haves. They are:

1. “Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.”

2. “Never go outside the expertise of your people.”

3. “Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.”

4. “Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules.”

5. “Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon.”

6. “A good tactic is one your people enjoy.”

7. “A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.”

8. “Keep the pressure on. Never let up.”

9. “The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.”

10. “The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition.”

11. “If you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.”

12. “The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.”

13. “Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.”
