* /u/hyde04: I called them directly. I informed that i was bullied as kid. On october 16, gawker media promoted bullying. Not only did the guy keep his job, but got a promotion. I told amazon that it would be demoralizing to me that such customer service oriented company would be affiliated with gawker. They said they would report my concerns.

* /u/randomchaos1: I'm an amazon prime user, just spoke with customer service they said they will make SURE the complaint is heard. Even the customer service rep I spoke to was pissed. DO NOT STOP, DO NOT GET LAZY. BE POLITE AND SWEET AND MAKE SURE AMAZON PULLS IT'S ADS OFF GAWKER.

* /u/axelsparkster: I just made my first Gamergate email ever today with your help OP. Thanks!

* /u/topshelfprivilege: Submitted a complaint through the corporate version since they have a separate version of "prime" (it's a bit different) for large businesses. Curious to see the response considering we spent ~$1,128,000 on Amazon within the last 12 months.

* /u/cowardscanstillemail: Been lurking since the beginning, finally got involved and sent an email. FUCK that felt good. Fellow lurkers, now's the time to email. Take it from the leader of gamergate, it feels great. You can stay anonymous on here and other boards (see my username).

* /u/pedroiswatching: I'm a prime customer, and I just submitted my letter to both the Associate department and directly to Jeff Bezos. I'll keep you posted.

* /u/mrpejorative: I submitted a complaint. I pointed out how frustrating it was that my money was indirectly going to Gawker, who were then attacking me, my friends or people I cared about. All completely true, and something I didn't think about until you pointed it out. Thanks! Prime will be easy for me to cancel as I rarely take advantage of it.
