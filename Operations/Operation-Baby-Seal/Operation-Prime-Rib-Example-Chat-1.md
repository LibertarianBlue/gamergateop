**Ashley:** Thank you for contacting the Amazon Associates Program. To access and discuss your account, may I get the following information associated with your Amazon.com account? - Email address - First and Last Name

**Me:** \<email address, first and last name\>

**Ashley:** Thank you for providing that information. How may I help you?

**Me:** I'd like to report ToS violations by Gawker Media.

**Ashley:** How may I help you with that?

**Me:** Well, bullying is a very personal matter to me. I was bullied a lot as a child. Employee Sam Biddle promoted bullying. Gawker promoted him in spite of this. Jezebel writers bragged about perpetrating domestic violence and encouraged it.

**Ashley:** I am very sorry to hear that. I will report this to the appropriate department for investigation.

**Me:** I appreciate it. They have also said hurtful things about me for my hobbies, comparing me to ISIS. As a military veteran, that is very hurtful

**Ashley:** I can imagine. I am sorry. I have reported it.

**Me:** I appreciate Amazon and your excellent service to military personnel serving overseas. I've been with you guys for many years, and just recently Amazon Fresh. If Amazon does not remove Gawker Media as an affiliate/associate, then I will not review my Amazon Prime and Fresh membership. I appreciate you taking the time to hear my concern.

**Ashley:** You are most welcome. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

**Me:** Well, would like to know if it is possible to cancel my Prime/Fresh membership. Not now, but within the next couple weeks.

**Ashley:** You can cancel it at any time, with either a full or partial refund, depending on how many times the benefits were used.

**Me:** Awesome. Thanks a lot, Ashley. That's all I have for you.

**Ashley:** You are welcome. Have a good day.
