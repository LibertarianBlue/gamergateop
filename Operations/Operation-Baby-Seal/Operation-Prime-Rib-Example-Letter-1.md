I am contacting you to report Amazon Associates ToS violations by Gawker Media. I would like to open this by saying that bullying is a very personal matter to me. I was bullied as a child and it affected my mental health for a very long time. I am now a PhD candidate at \<university\> and study bullying and crime.

I think you could certainly agree that bullying is something that should be taken very seriously.

With that, I am reporting (with archives in case they take them down) several violations of Amazon Associates ToS. If Amazon does not remove Gawker Media as an affiliate/associate, then I will not renew my Amazon Prime membership, will tell others not to buy Amazon Prime, and will likely refrain from using Amazon for a while until I get confirmation that Amazon will no longer associate with Gawker Media. There are many others who are protesting Gawker Media for similar reasons, and you are likely getting a lot of emails about this, but I wanted to add my own.
