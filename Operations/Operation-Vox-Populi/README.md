# Operation Vox Populi TL;DR

* Write boycott emails to Vox Media's advertisers: https://v.gd/tj7daq
* Do not use the words GamerGate or \#GamerGate anywhere in the emails.
* Mention that Vox Media properties (Vox, Polygon, The Verge) have spoken insultingly and hatefully against gamers, their core demographic. You can cite some or all of the articles here: https://v.gd/XR9Sam
* Also mention that they have gone so far as to attack their own advertisers, and that advertising on these properties has become a complete liability. You can cite some or all of the articles https://v.gd/33WRA5
* As soon as you send each email, paste its contents into a TwitLonger, fill in the details into the TwitLonger subject line (company, contact person, #GamerGate and #OpVox hashtags) and tweet. This part is optional, but increases the operation's impact. Note that the #OperationVoxPopuli hashtag has been retired for being too long, and has been replaced by #OpVox.
* Favorite and retweet other people's #OpVox and #OperationVoxPopuli TwitLonger tweets. This part is optional, but increases the operation's impact.
* Do this on each Sunday and Wednesday night.
