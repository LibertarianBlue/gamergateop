## Step 2: Conflict of interest
Here is a list of all that I have found, you should have your own copy of the files so if you can find more add them but don’t flood the email choose ONE conflict and then use another if you’re emailing someone else, if you can’t just roll with it.

Rock Paper Shotgun: http://i.imgur.com/Hi6BT1O.jpg

Giant Bomb: http://i.imgur.com/Hi6BT1O.jpg

Gawker Media: http://i.imgur.com/Hi6BT1O.jpg

Choose one of these, then the article you need and express your anger at being treated like crap after raising legitimate concerns

## Step 3: Choose an article of the company you’re reporting

'Gamers' don't have to be your audience. 'Gamers' are over. Exclusive - Leigh Alexander

## Step 4: Now you’ve chosen who you’re going to email here are some ideas on how to write the email…

- Open with Dear… followed by their surname/company name

- Apologize if the email has gone to the wrong place but tell them that you have some serious concerns for the site they’re advertising on.

- Write how you found the article in question or friend showed you it or that you saw it on social media and mention the author and the site it was from, it’s only relevant if they’re advertising on the site (cap obv much)

- Show them some offensive quotes there are tons to work with, don’t over do it be calm about it, say that you used to read the site allot or that you tried to

- Look into the company’s products if they don’t have any mention that you will not be going to the site it might seem like an empty threat but remember that there will be hundreds of emails going on at once saying the same thing.

- End with your name an alias is too easy to dismiss.

Here are some links to other emails (this isn’t my work) if you need a bit more detail, credit goes to Taco Justice who supplied these check out his video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEpSXZ6vBN0

## Step 5: Keeping the fires going and being an annoying little shit

“What if I don’t get a response on day 1!?”

Keep calm, post another, it’s best to save your email prior (use word) and then put it back in but do a follow up so…

Dear (Insert company or surname here)

- Ask if they got the last email, applogize and tell them that your very passionate about gaming and you don’t like the kind of hate speech the site gave or the type of message it gave.

- Still nothing? Try and re-phrase the letter again and don’t lose your cool, eventually they’ll get back to you and want to deal with the problem because it’ll be irritating them.

FYI this is how you get most stuff done, pester companies.
