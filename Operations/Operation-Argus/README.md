### Suggested Topics to FOIA:

So far we have reason to believe that there is at least one investigation ongoing:

- Investigation into two publications not following paid endorsement rules.  
(We currently do not know which two publications are being investigated, we suspect Gawker may be one but file seperate FOIAs for each publication that may be involved in this: Kotaku, Vox Media, Rock Paper Shotgun, Gamasutra and any others)

More topics to FOIA will be added as additional information becomes available!

## Tips on Making a Successful FOIA Request:

* https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2014/feb/12/quick-protip-better-fbi-foia-requests/

**TL;DR:** You can request documents about a specific topic of investigation on a specific subject, such as all death threats received by Ms. Jane Doe. However, more specific requests are more likely to be filled more quickly. If you ask for any documents pertaining to [x] event that happened on [y] date, limited to [z] time period, you will be much more likely to get what you want.

We must coordinate to have different people ask for the records of an investigation on the different points of interest we need info on.

We must send a large number of requests in order to compile a repository of all information relevant to #GamerGate.

**This is the next step in #GamerGate.** We must not neglect the emails to advertisers; however, **we must send these FoIA requests in order to acquire intel needed to gain the public trust.**

Let Operation Argus commence.
